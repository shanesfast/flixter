# FLIXTER

Share your knowledge by creating a course which you can sell to knowledge hungry students. If you would rather learn something new, sign up and select a course which can be paid for with a debit or credit card via stripe. You can be both a student and a teacher on Flixter! Feel free to fork this project and make it your own!
